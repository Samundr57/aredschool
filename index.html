        <h3 style="color: blue;">MR. RAJKUMAR (DIRECTOR)</h3>
        <p> I feel honoured and privileged to be part of an educational institution where every stakeholder is a learner
          and every day is an opportunity to learn and discover. We look at ourselves as a community of learners, where
          everyone learns including our teachers, parents & staff.</p>

        <img class="teacher" src="img2/ravinder.jpg" alt="director1">
        <h3 style="color: blue;">MR. RAVINDER</h3>
        <p> Mastering a skill means putting in the time and effort it takes to become good at something. It’s easy to
          see a master at work and forget that it took hours of work to get to that level. <br> If you set your mind to
          it and train or study hard, you can learn any skill you want.</p>

        <img class="teacher" src="img2/dalbir.jpg" alt="director2">
        <h3 style="color: blue;">MR. DALBIR SINGH</h3>
        <p> What you’re studying today, nobody can take away from you again. Knowledge is a power that stays with you as long as you keep using it. Use this power wisely to grow and become the person you want to be.</p>

        <img class="teacher" src="img2/vedparkash.jpg" alt="director3">
        <h3 style="color: blue;">MR. VEDPARKASH ARYA</h3>
        <p>  Fight the fear of failure with a positive attitude towards your studies. It’s natural to make mistakes when you’re learning something new. Remember that if you’re not getting started you can’t succeed either.</p>

        <img class="feature-img" src="img2/cocurricular.jpg" alt="cocurricular activity">
        <h3>01 Extra Cocurricular Activities</h3>
        <p>Co-curricular activities in our school are designed to complement the academic curriculum by providing students with opportunities for holistic development. From sports teams to clubs and societies, there's a diverse range of activities catering to different interests and talents.

        <h3>02 Well maintained computer lab</h3>
        <p>Digital IT Lab aims to revolutionize traditional learning methods by integrating interactive technologies into the educational process.

        <img class="feature-img" src="img2/playground.jpg" alt="playground">
        <h3>03 Awesome Playgrounds</h3>
        <p>A good playground will be large with many different surfaces (blacktop, grass, sand, etc.) to stimulate choice and leave options open. The playgrounds must be spacious and outdoors, but they must also be secluded so that the children and their parents feel safe and do not have to consider the outside world. Ensuring ample shade and seating areas further enhances the comfort and enjoyment of both children and caregivers, creating a welcoming environment for all.</p>
